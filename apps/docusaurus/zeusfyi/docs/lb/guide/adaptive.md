# Adaptive

Once you have ~20 or so request samples for the same method, the load balancer will start to use the adaptive strategy
automatically and manage the routing group table for you based on the best predicted performing endpoint for that method
that's available.

Stats will only persist for one hour since the last API call for that method, so you'll need to keep making requests to
keep the stats. It doesn't take long, only ~20 samples per metric to trend towards a near optimal routing group table
from scratch, so it's really not a big deal to reset the stats.

You can tune the adaptive scale factors for your application, but the defaults are pretty good for most applications.

### Example:

#### JSON-RPC

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_getBlockByNumber",
  "params": [
    "latest",
    true
  ],
  "id": 1
}
```

```sh
curl --location ‘https://iris.zeus.fyi/v1/router’ \
--header ‘Content-Type: application/json’ \
--header ‘Authorization: Bearer YOUR-BEARER-TOKEN’ \
--header ‘X-Route-Group: ethereum-mainnet’ \
--data ‘{“jsonrpc”:“2.0”,“method”:“eth_getBlockByNumber”,“params”:[“latest”, true],“id”:1}’
```
